# Crystal Collector Game 



The player will have to guess the answer. The player will guess with numbers instead of letters.


There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. When players click on the crystal the player's score will update.


The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses.


The random number shown at the start of the game is between 19 - 120. Each crystal has a random hidden value between 1-12.
